Our fleet of spaceships are all equipped with radio transmitters, which can be operated by the astronaut in case they are in need of rescue. To call for help, astronauts can use the transmitter to send out sequences made of two types of radio waves - 0 and 1. However, both types of waves may also be produced by natural phenomena, such as celestial body activities - in this case, 0 and 1 are equally likely to appear. Everyone in space knows that by current technical standard, radio receivers can only pick up 10 waves in a row - that is, you can only detect sequences that have 10 waves (as mentioned before, each wave is either 0 or 1). If you receive a sequence and think it was produced by natural phenomena, you will ignore it and stay on course. If you think it came from humans, then we will send a rescue team. In this study, you will see about 250 sequences. Your task is to decide whether each sequence was generated by a natural phenomenon or by a human astronaut.
